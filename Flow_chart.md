# Project Flow Chart

You may write your flow chart here or upload it as a separate file. 
* If you upload it, be sure to upload a new version at the end, keeping the original version.
* If you use this one, the original will still be available so you just need to save (commit) each time you make changes.
* you've started your risky business day game: choose your own adventure: 
* first up: what are you selling this afternoon(pick two items/experiences)? 
* Do you want to (1) help start selling input1 with your partner(S) or (2) go scope out the nusinesses next door?
